 A Robot which will perform  the different morning tasks which most of us perform before going to class in college
for us to simplify our lives.
Every day in the morning we need to complete some set of predefined tasks that remain
constant. We can list the generic tasks as below:
1. Ring the alarm on time
2. Make coffee
3. Heat the water to a suitable temperature
4. Pack your bag (Keep only appropriate books for the day)
5. Cook breakfast and lunch
6. Iron the clothes


From now on a Kotlin Robot will complete the above set of tasks for us.
